# shopping_list
A location based shopping app

# Updates

1. Updated the master branch from local repo due to failures in loading to devices
2. Fixed issues with maps on Android
3. Removed node_modules using gitignore (FYI these may be needed to be installed locally though sidekick should it prompt)
4. Added FAB (floating action button) and add shopping list with basic functionality
5. Added addList page - passes list between addList and Home via data provider under providers/data/
6. Added login page - accessed through the menu bar and clicking on the avatar at the top
7. Login page saves a user data, this can be changed to store until logout or only while app is open
8. List functional 100% - data is retained / items able to be added.
