# shopping_list
A location based shopping app

# Updates

1. Updated the master branch from local repo due to failures in loading to devices
2. Fixed issues with maps on Android
3. Removed node_modules (FYI these will need to be installed locally though sidekick should prompt)
4. Added FAB (floating action button) and add shopping list with basic functionality
5. Added addList page - passes list between addList and Home via data provider under providers/data/

# Map

Just the maps which will show the current location and surrounding shops (user defined area and shops)
